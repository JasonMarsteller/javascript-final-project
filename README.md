Final Project for Javascript Class - Southwest Tech

This is my final project for my Javascript Class at Southwest Tech.  I converted the W3Schools Game Instruction code to be something that my child would enjoy playing with.  The primary changes I made were to bind the movement options to the direction keys, and adjust the movement to be vertically focused instead of horizontal.
